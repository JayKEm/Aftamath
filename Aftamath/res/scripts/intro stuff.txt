Narrator: New game, ~huh? So you want to start yor life over?
	Old life not good enough for you?
	Well, I don't knoe exactly what it is you're thinking of finding in here...
	But I'm sre there's a whole bunch of stupid stuff in this dumb game yo may find worthwile.
	So let's start with the basics. ~The real slims./pName, gender, DOB, all that jazz.
	You know the drill. ~How could you not? Oh wait, I forgot you weren't the brightest.
	Sorry, sorry. Get over it. We're starting for real now.
	Right-~/cRight after you tell me your name.

	And your gender.

	1)

	2)


	3) Sorry, but we don't do that in this game.
	There's just not enough spa- I mean memory for this game for 'other' genders.
	3) Seroiusly! Do you even know how hard it is to make games like this?
	You have to make some sacrifices in order to get the ball rolling, you know, so you can actually finish the thing.
	'Other' genders happened to be one of them.
	3) Alright. ~Game over. /pI'm not putting up with you. I can't I'm done.
	Didn't I just tell you...
