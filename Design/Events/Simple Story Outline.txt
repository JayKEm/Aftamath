Here's the basic storyline:

-There are two businesses competing for the market of one product. One is a large, well established business, the other is a bit smaller and with its own issues. 
	-The product is something that is tied with the ending: that the narrator is actually in control of the city, and that the city is all a fake digital world (tell me if this isn't what you meant, Julian)
		-The narrator starts out not knowing what the product actually is, only sort of different parts of the product
			-I haven't totally thought of what the product is yet. I'm thinking something everyone has, and also something that hints towards the end of the game
				-A cat? (like, how can someone make a cat if the world isn't a manufactured one? ergo, the world is a manufactured one)
	-The player gets to choose which business they want to work for (or maybe they decide to work for neither). They can move up in the ranks of the big business, or try to figure out how the hell to even help the small business
-General almost conspiracy storyline with aid supplied by the (F)RI
-This document is subject to frequent updates
