Supervillain/hero origins: Jimmy   -Beau Sahaj
Leon, Sarah, Jimmy
Description: Leon and Sarah are a married couple who love quoting movies more than anything. Everything they say is trying to impress other people with their movie quoting skills. Sarah’s little brother Jimmy tags along with them to get their approval, but always messes up the quote in a small but obviously noticeable way. Leon and Sarah are always visibly annoyed with him. (include a few dialogue scenes with the three of them before the main quest starts.)
Questline start: You walk into a restaurant, and the three of them are sitting at a table with a waiter next to them. 
Waiter: What would you like to order this evening?
Leon: We’re all having the liver…
Sarah: With some fava beans…
Jimmy: and a nice beer!
Sarah: …  Dang it, Jimmy!
Jimmy: That isn’t the right quote?
Sarah: No! It’s a nice Chianti!
Jimmy: But I hate wine.
Sarah: Doesn’t matter.
Leon: You need to get it right next time or we won’t invite you to dinner.
Jimmy: Fine! (Jimmy leaves the restaurant)	
Waiter: …
Sarah: I’ll have a burger actually.
Leon: I’ll have what she’s having.
(if you leave the restaurant and come back before talking to Jimmy, Leon will say “Mmm, now this is a tasty burger!” 
 A huge new movie (Post-apocalyptic teen love triangle: book 3, part 2) is opening. Talk to Jimmy, and he asks you to get him tickets, since Leon and Sarah haven’t invited him. Dialogue options: “A: I could ask Leon and Sarah for one” “B: I could sneak you in to the theater.” “C: I’ll buy one for you” 
A: Go to Leon and Sarah’s house:
Sarah: Hello. You’re (player name), right? Of course you are. How’ve you been?
Options- A: Why are you so mean to Jimmy? 
                 B: Do you have a spare ticket for TPALT 3-2?
(option A leads through a conversation and then you’re only left with choice B)
A-	Sarah: because he’s annoying.  (work on this section more)
You: He just wants to be cool and he thinks the only way is to be like you.
Sarah: He keeps messing up and embarrassing us in public though.

B-	You: Actually, Jimmy wants to see the new movie with you this weekend. Do you have a ticket?
Sarah: Maybe, but you’ll have to do me a favor first.
You: What’s that?
Sarah: Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to steal a book of movie quotes from the library for me. Bring it back and the ticket’s yours.
(If you look around the house, Sarah will tell you she hid the ticket.)
Exit Sarah’s house to see Leon on the front steps.
Leon: Please get us that book, (player). It’s the only copy in town.
Options: “…I’ll be back!” or “I’ll take care of it.”
Leon: “I’ll be back” response: “ !!!   I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship.”                    Other response: “Thanks. See you in a bit.”
B: 
C: (continuing the conversation with Jimmy)
Jimmy: you can’t buy it. It’s sold out!
You: is there anything else you want?
Jimmy: There’s a book on movie quotes in the library I’ve wanted for years. Sarah wants it too, but they won’t let us check it out. Could you get it for me and not her? I might be able to trade it for a ticket.
You: Sure. I’ll be back!
Jimmy: Oh my gosh! I love Robocop!    …oh wait






Notes: all three threads lead to the library to get the book Jimmy’s rejection by Leon and Sarah after embarrassing himself in the theater causes him to turn into a comic book supervillain. In the climactic battle, he uses the quote from MK annihilation “Too bad YOU… will die!”
