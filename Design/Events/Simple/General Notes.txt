Major question that should be resolved [undecided as of yet]:
	What is the ultimate identity of the CEO?

Bussiness notes:
-General militaristic/feudal feel
-Gags:
	-Awkward bathroom interactions (like at urinal in an empty bathroom, everytime someone walks in they choose the urinal next to you out of all the other ones)
	-Easter eggs to sitcoms?
	-Different office themes every weekday (Twerk to Work Tuesday, Formal Friday)
-Characters:
	-Money Bags
	-CEO
	-Startup CEO (for minor storyline during 2nd task assigned at meeting)
-Note:
	-Final coup involves knights (to incorportate militaristic feudal feel)

Homeless notes:
-General fratty/literary feel
-Gags:
	-Initial homelessguy keeps on flashing you (with more pixelated pixels)
-Characters:
	-Initial homelessguy (Underpriviledged Brad "unlike the rest of us. We're all super priviledged" [acknowledge this contradiction])
	-Sarcastic Brad (says stuff like "Yeah, I *don't* want you to infiltrate the business" and you struggle to tell if he's serious at first [he's not])

Ending:
-If sucessfully completed storyline (either business or homeless), then ending with the narrator that Julian described where player learns that the City is actually all virtually controlled by the narrator
